    <p class="over-map">Today, Brown owns over <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Facilities_Management/maps/#type/BUILDINGS">230</a> buildings in and around Providence. Recent property growth has concentrated in the Jewelry District, representing a new era of expansion for the University off College Hill and into downtown.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 50vh" class="over-map">But the campus wasn’t always so expansive.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Below, The Herald has mapped the University’s property purchases from 1764 to today — as well as its property sales. The information comes from the Providence Public Library's atlas collection, the John Hay Library's special collections, the Brown Daily Herald archives, the Providence Preservation Society's Most Endangered Properties lists, the Rhode Island State Archives in the office of the Department of State, the Brown Real Estate Office archives, the Providence Journal archives and Encyclopedia Brunoniana.</p>

    <p>The information below is imperfect, especially predating 2002 when the city of Providence began publishing its complete <a href="https://data.providenceri.gov/browse?q=property+tax+roll">property tax rolls</a> online. The maps from 1764 to 2000 include many specific properties, but others can be considered best estimates for when the University purchased the land that new key buildings later stood upon. These maps likely miss a number of properties that we could not find in the archives. If you have a correction, addition or knowledge of when Brown acquired certain properties, please email Herald@BrownDailyHerald.com.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The original campus was two adjacent lots spanning what is now the Quiet Green, Main Green and Ruth J. Simmons Quad. At this time there were no paved roads, so the true boundaries of campus extended a bit beyond its contemporary confines.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Between 1770 and 1900, the outline of Brown’s campus beyond the Main Green took shape. The University bought the first building on what is now the Pembroke campus in 1897, acquired Pembroke Field, land on Thayer Street, and land that would become the Brown Stadium.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The early 20th century saw campus expansion to make room for the Women’s College, later <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/history/timeline/">renamed</a> Pembroke College. The Sayles Gym — now Smith-Buonanno Hall — and land which would become Andrews Hall were acquired by the University in this time frame.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Under the administration of President Henry Wriston, rapid and extensive campus expansion became a key priority for the University. Beginning in 1922, the University gradually bought the homes and buildings on the land of what would become Wriston Quad and Keeney Quad.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>By 1960, the University’s two largest residential quads — Wriston and Keeney — were complete.</p>
    <p>Farview, Inc., a nonprofit corporation legal entity fully owned by the University, was incorporated in 1958. This subsidiary was meant to help with the acquisition of properties that would remain commercial or taxable. The University also acquired the rest of the land that would eventually become the Life Sciences Quad and Barus and Holley — the latter of which led to a lengthy zoning dispute with the city.</p>
    <p>“The issue,” President Barnaby Keeney told The Herald at the time, “is essentially whether Brown goes up in the air, spreads out more or stands still. We are quite prepared to operate under City policies that will permit us to go up or spread out. If the pressure on the University is to stand still, we shall have to resist.”</p>
    <hr>
    <p>By the mid-1960s, Farview was listed as the owner of 15 to 20 properties in and around Providence. Off-campus living was on the rise, and in the decades prior to 1980 Brown leased out several properties on John Street. Students began to spread into Fox Point, contributing to rising rents and displacement. </p>
    <p>Institutionally, the University took on more non-educational and commercial properties, looking ahead to bigger plans and future dorms. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In the 1980s the university acquired the final buildings and lots to get the block that would become the Vartan Gregorian quad, which opened in 1991. In the 1990s, through purchases made by Farview, Brown also acquired the strip mall on Brook Street which included Bagel Gourmet, Mini Mart and a police station. </p>
    <p>These structures were <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/10/demolition-for-brook-street-dorm-to-begin-mid-october">demolished</a> during the fall semester of 2021 to make way for the Brook Street Dormitories, indicating the breadth of the University’s vision when it comes to property acquisition.	</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In the 2000s, Brown began a conscious effort to expand off College Hill. President Ruth J. Simmons’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040807001800/http://www.brown.edu/webmaster/acad_plan.html#community">Plan for Academic Enrichment</a> — the first public-facing University plans that explicitly called for expansion beyond College Hill — the University set its sights upon the Jewelry District, where it has expanded its research facilities, medical school, office of admission and more.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the administration of President Christina Paxson P’19 launched the <a href="https://distinction.brown.edu/">Building on Distinction</a> plan, a strategic initiative for campus development in pursuit of Brown’s academic mission. </p>
    <p>And since 2019, with the dissolution of Farview, the University has converted much of its once-commercial property into student housing — tearing down houses and a strip mall on multiple, separate blocks of Brook Street to create the Sternlicht Commons Health and Wellness Dorm and the Brook Street dorms. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>“Being a residential university and a research-intensive university comprises a significant need for space,” said Executive Vice President for Planning and Policy Russell Carey ’91.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>During the tenure of the Paxson administration, her team sought to build upon the Simmons administration’s strategic plan. Carey explained that the “Building on Distinction” plan aimed “to fulfill our academic mission and (have) excellent and adequate facilities in order to do that.”</p>

    <p>Today, acquisitions on College Hill are “less frequent, because there&#39;s less available space,” Carey said. The Jewelry District has seen more institutional growth because of land made available by the 2009 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/realestate/commercial/11iway.html">relocation</a> of the I-195 highway.</p>

    <p>The University has a mix of institutional and commercial holdings, and its . Brown’s “primary mission is not commercial activity.” There is “a mix of reasons” for the University’s ownership of commercial entities, Carey said. “We’re not running large commercial enterprises or seeking to do so.”&nbsp;</p>

    <p>On Thayer, the University is the landlord for shops such as Insomnia Cookies, Berk’s and Warby Parker. According to Carey, Brown has been “actively involved for decades” with the Thayer Street District Management Association, having representatives on the board.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>And over the last 20 years, the University has sold as much or more property compared to its acquisitions, Carey said —&nbsp;part of a “conscious effort … to identify properties that are not critical to the mission and can be better utilized in other ways.” That includes the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/real-estate/brown-brown-home-ownership">Brown to Brown</a> program — which renovates and sells homes to Brown community members — and the sale of former University property which is now Narragansett Brewery.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Brown’s tax footprint&nbsp;</h2>

    <p>Institutional properties —&nbsp;including dormitories, academic buildings and dining halls — are property tax-exempt, because they are for academic use. Commercial properties owned by Brown&nbsp; — such as the Brown Bookstore and Hemenway’s restaurant — are taxed commercially.</p>

    <p>Carey explained that while Brown’s institutional tax-exempt status is crucial to its nonprofit mission, the University is “extraordinarily aware and sensitive” of the importance that property tax revenue holds for Providence.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The University is “very committed to the financial sustainability and success of the city of Providence,” he said. Currently, Brown has two tax-related agreements in place with the city: the 2003 <a href="https://www.brown.edu/gcr/sites/gcr/files/2003_MOU.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> and the 2012 <a href="https://www.brown.edu/gcr/sites/gcr/files/2012_MOA.pdf">Memorandum of Agreement</a>, which both expire in January 2023, The Herald <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/02/payments-for-tax-exempt-properties-reconsidered">previously reported</a>. The 2003 agreement includes all private nonprofit institutions in Providence, requiring a 15-year phase-out period “when properties are acquired that were tax-generating … become tax-exempt,” Carey said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The 2003 memorandum included 20 years of cash payments “directly to the city from Brown,” Carey explained. The 2012 MOA also required “cash payments to the city every year.” Renegotiations for the agreements in January are a “high priority for the institutions and the incoming mayor,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>With these agreements, Farview “had less utility and wasn’t necessary,” leading to its 2019 dissolution, Carey explained. Properties previously owned by Farview that the University has not sold are still owned by the University, and commercial properties continue to be taxed.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>To secure financing to renovate the building that is now the Warren Alpert Medical school, build an urban park and create a police substation, the University established another subsidiary in 2010, Karing, Inc., University Spokesperson Brian Clark wrote in an email to The Herald. It was dissolved in 2019.</p>

    <p>When the University acquired River House in 2021, Carey said it created a specific subsidiary: River House 1, LLC. Since the property had a <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/07/brown-purchases-river-house-to-turn-into-graduate-student-housing">pre-existing</a> tax-stabilization agreement which Brown assumed, establishing the subsidiary made it “very clear that we were going to honor (the TSA).”</p>

    <p>Apart from River House 1 LLC, “having a standing separate but wholly owned entity just for (commercial holdings and expansion) is not something that we see any need for,” Carey explained. “That’s why we closed (Farview) down.”</p>

    <h2>Community impact</h2>

    <p>“It appears to us that Brown views the properties it owns as Brown campus,” Providence Preservation Society Executive Director Brent Runyon said, “whereas I think many people would agree that one of the most attractive features of Brown is that it is … integrated into the surrounding neighborhood of College Hill.”&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This disconnect makes it so Brown seems “to have very low regard for the <a href="https://guide.ppsri.org/list/college-hill-national-hd">College Hill National Historic District</a>,” Runyon said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Though there was a time when the University <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2018-12-17/sharpe">moved historic structures</a>, those opportunities have diminished “because there just isn&#39;t that much open space,” Runyon said.</p>

    <p>“Expansion has been aggressive,” he added.</p>

    <p>Runyon said some of Brown’s acquisitions and replacements — like fast food restaurants and a gas station on Angell Street&nbsp; — were beneficial. But other efforts, like a failed plan to demolish buildings including the Urban Environmental Lab for the Lindemann Performing Arts Center “really disregard the neighborhood, and so there is a lot of friction between neighbors,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Historic districts and other preservation measures are in place but cannot protect all properties. The <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/07/college-hill-historic-district-expansion-passes-despite-prior-university-objections">2021 historic district overlay</a> expansion included three Brown properties, down from the 21 in the original proposal, The Herald <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/02/university-expresses-opposition-to-historic-district-ordinance-at-public-hearing">previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Runyon also emphasized that the University’s footprint <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/04/browns-footprint-today-student-housing-taxation">extends</a> well past what its official property holdings as students and graduate students proliferate further off College Hill.</p>

    <p>The University has “a constant set of relationships and communications” with neighborhood organizations, key stakeholders — such as the PPS and 195 District Commission — and government officials and departments, Carey said. For large-scale projects, with the <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/09/brown-begins-planning-for-construction-of-new-life-sciences-building-in-jewelry-district">integrated life sciences building</a> “front-and-center right now,” there is extensive community outreach.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Additionally, the University solicits community feedback when it creates its Institutional Master Plans submitted every five years to the city, Carey said.</p>

    <p>“We’ve seen an unbounded expansion of the University,” Ward 1 Councilman John Goncalves ’23 MA’15 said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Goncalves said that the expansion can be “exciting”: “We all recognize Brown’s symbiotic relationship with the city of Providence and positive impact,” including job-creation, voluntary payments and public-private partnerships, Goncalves said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>But he pointed to the problem of the “human displacement of the former denizens of Fox Point,” where a vibrant <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/04/the-magnitude-of-the-community-that-we-had-fox-point-gentrification-urban-renewal">immigrant community</a> once stood. College students priced out longtime residents as rents and property values have risen. Highway construction and urban renewal also <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/04/the-magnitude-of-the-community-that-we-had-fox-point-gentrification-urban-renewal">displaced</a> many residents.</p>

    <p>According to Goncalves, the University’s property assessments are close to <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/02/payments-for-tax-exempt-properties-reconsidered">$1.3 billion</a> in total and would generate close to $50 million if taxed at the commercial rate.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Brown, Goncalves said, could do more for Providence. “The thing that a lot of people would like to see is Brown pitching in more of its fair share to alleviate some of the burden that property taxpayers or taxpayers in the city have to shoulder.”&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>[Jewelry District]</h2>

    <p>First purchase in the Jewelry District TK. Since then, the University has become a major player in the area, with NUMBER total properties.</p>

    <p>“There was a strategic decision to think of our campus as having two elements, one based on College Hill and one based in the Jewelry District,” said University Spokesperson Brian Clark.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The College Hill campus focuses on “undergraduate instruction, faculty research and student life” while the Jewelry District is in the process of becoming “a mixed-use environment that focuses on medical education, scientific research and … administrative space,” Clark added.</p>

    <p>“The Jewelry District itself is very different than most other neighborhoods,” said Jewelry District Association President Sharon Steele. In the early 20th century, the Jewelry District was the city’s “center of manufacturing,” Steele said, but faced decline when the interstate ran through “so close that it nearly touched the building that I now live in.”&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/realestate/commercial/11iway.html">relocation</a> of I-195 opened up many parcels in the neighborhood. Though most developments have been residential, there is hope for new jobs and business activity in the area that make the area “very much like the neighborhood that we used to be,” Steele said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The University hopes to bring “new life to that neighborhood and (support) city and state goals,” Clark added. Carey noted that parcels in the Jewelry District from Care New England <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2022/07/01/brown-university-expands-downtown-footprint-16-million-purchase-jewelry-district-plans-build-new-lab/7780366001/">purchased this summer</a> “will support opportunities for …&nbsp; research growth.” There are “opportunities to do that in the Jewelry District in a way that is beneficial and is welcomed by the community.”</p>

    <p>The University aims to develop projects that create “both near-term construction jobs and long-term economic growth and sustainable activity,” Carey said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Brown’s role as an anchor tenant in the RIDOH laboratory building has enabled the developers to build out space for potential commercial entities, particularly commercial laboratory space, he explained.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The University has engaged in similar developments at South Street Landing — a power plant that sat vacant for almost 20 years — and 225 Dyer St. Brown recently committed to a lease of an additional floor for laboratory space, Carey said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Over time, Steele believes Brown’s Jewelry District properties will eventually resemble the campus on College Hill. “What we have is the most collaborative, communicative relationship that I could ever wish to have with any major institution in the state,” Steele said, citing the JDA’s work with Paxson and her administrative team. Steele said the administration is a “partner,” and “they demonstrate it every single day.”</p>

    <p>The University informs the JDA of its plans years in advance, Steeleshe said. “We have a seat at the table.,” Steele said.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>“We have the ability now to basically create a brand new neighborhood out of whole cloth, and that is a rare opportunity,” Steele said. “With that opportunity comes enormous responsibility, and we feel that we could not have a better partner than we have in Brown.”</p>

    <p>“It is our mutual goal to basically make this place better than the way we have found it,” Steele said.&nbsp;</p>
